Python 'proof of concepts' project
==================================

An educational project to demonstrate and test the features of Python.

## Why are you testing Python source code?

Yep, I hear ya... we should usually write unit tests only for our own code, and not for code that is built into Python. But this is just an educational project, and I think writing tests in this way is:

* a good way to learn the features of a language;
* something to refer back to if you need to remember how things work;
* useful because you can run them against multiple versions of the language to see how they differ.
